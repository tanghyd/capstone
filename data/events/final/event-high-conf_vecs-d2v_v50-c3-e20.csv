The mineralising fluids are possibly derived from porphyries that intrude the sequences although surface gold values are generally low over the porphyries.

The olivine adcumulates, host to Type 2 NiS mineralisation are the thicker lenticular part of the komatiitic sequences and were originally interpreted as intrusive dykes, (e.g., Burt and Sheppy, 1975; Binns et al., 1977, 1982; Groves and Keays, 1979; Marston et al., 1981), sill-like feeder chambers for the overlying spinifex-textured komatiites (Naldrett and Turner, 1977; Lesher and Groves, 1986) or ponded lava lakes (Donaldson et al., 1986).

These sequences are overlain by the E-facing Jones Creek Conglomerate, the basal contact of which represents a major Archan unconformity (Durney, 1972; Marston and Travis, 1976), dated at 2.695 Ga 0.015 (Rb-Sr total rock age; Roddick et al., 1976).",the mineralised komatiite of interest to this study lie in the ug a narrow 5 km wide in the mt keith six mile well area elongate 240 km long belt that strike nnw dip w and be dominantly w face the stratigraphy for the ug be poorly understand comprise of volcanic and volcanoclastic rock acid felsic mafic sedimentary rock pelites shales and chert basalts pillow tholeiitic and high mg and komatiite sequence olivine ad mesoorthocumulate and thin spinifex texture flow the olivine adcumulates host to type 2 nis mineralisation be the thick lenticular part of the komatiitic sequence and be originally interpret as intrusive dyke e.g. burt and sheppy 1975 binns et al 1977 1982 grove and keays 1979 marston et al 1981 sill like feeder chamber for the overlie spinifex texture komatiites naldrett and turner 1977 lesher and grove 1986 or ponde lava lakes donaldson et al 1986 however a more recent interpretation indicate that these komatiite form as channelize flow barnes et al 1988c hill et al 1990b 1995 dowling and hill 1990 these sequence be overlie by the e face jones creek conglomerate the basal contact of which represent a major archan unconformity durney 1972 marston and travis 1976 date at 2.695 ga 0.015 rb sr total rock age roddick et al 1976,False,-0.03496775,0.6550307,-0.31761703,-0.6464838,0.015537779,0.5985277,1.1027244,-1.1833168,-0.71406966,-0.24686867,-0.6623824,-0.2974252,-0.0009988833,0.06040351,0.3069146,0.28568676,-0.75947446,-0.8112877,-0.26960126,0.21622689,-0.19151737,-0.039893553,-0.21897367,-0.8487551,-0.3946288,-0.63783664,0.22478794,-0.7847126,-0.30822986,-0.77083063,0.47317767,1.3272512,0.11119608,-0.8162923,1.4883724,0.97979313,-0.7736092,1.2667737,0.49412298,0.33056602,0.013327867,0.3954874,-0.017126217,-0.36132538,-0.39872384,-0.34235996,-0.09433718,-0.04944557,-0.50344497,1.4458609

Uranium carried in solution and precipitated in recent surface deposits is normally classed as young and is not likely to be in radiogenic equilibrium with its daughter products that produce the measured radiometric signature.

The Assay results received for the diamond holes 08FCHDD001 and 08FCHDD002 showed negligible CU/Pb/Zn, which indicates that there is no potential mineralisation in the zone drilled. The negligible results could also indicate that only the upper part of the Upper Shale and Upper Hanging Wall were drilled of the Nifty Stratigraphic column, and these units have never supported any mineralisation, and had been classified as barren units. To obtain a bigger picture of the underground geology, and if indeed the geology is part of the Nifty Syncline, more stratigraphic units of the Nifty Stratigraphic column need to be intersected, especially the upper, middle and lower carbonate units, as it is these units which host the sulphide mineralisation found in the Nifty deposit.

The mineralization is predominantly stratabound within the siltstones.

This mapping also supports an interpretation that the Mosquito Creek Formation can be subdivided into two parts; the upper part characterised by interlayered shale, siltstone and thinly bedded, fine to mediumgrained sandstone, and the lower part containing a greater abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (interlayered with shale, siltstone and fine to medium-grained sandstone).

The dyke is probably unrelated to the known mineralisation and the MMR anomaly which are probably associated with shearing/strike slip faulting within the greenstone stratigraphy.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 9.1 Conclusions The Project is a highly prospective conceptual iron-ore exploration opportunity that has the potential to contain significant amounts of Detrital and or Robe Pisolite deposits. Note that it is likely that the average P content of Pilbara ores will increase with time, potentially making the above materials increasingly attractive for blending purposes. The current depletion in the Pilbara Iron resource base at Paraburdoo coupled with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the Ashburton Project, should lead to an increase in interest by Pilbara Iron. The relative close proximity to the FMG rail at Christmas Creek may also attract interest from FMG, who are keen to demonstrate to the market place that they have the potential resource base to both maintain there current proposed rate of production their proposed capacity expansions.",this pattern of sensitivity be not unusual for mining project in australia conclusion and recommendation 9.1 conclusion the project be a highly prospective conceptual iron ore exploration opportunity that have the potential to contain significant amount of detrital and or robe pisolite deposit note that be likely that the average p content of pilbara ore will increase with time potentially make the above material increasingly attractive for blend purpose the current depletion in the pilbara iron resource base at paraburdoo couple with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the ashburton project should lead to an increase in interest by pilbara iron the relative close proximity to the fmg rail at christmas creek may also attract interest from fmg who be keen to demonstrate to the market place that have the potential resource base to both maintain there current propose rate of production propose capacity expansion,False,0.61137265,0.1011382,0.19600053,0.27750924,-0.7495056,0.28126228,0.8758041,0.2683371,1.1006533,0.78507733,0.016147286,-0.37313765,0.11706413,-0.8648739,-0.25565717,-1.0162535,0.020120047,0.6308296,-0.6570206,0.11221133,0.14903735,-0.28755713,0.31631353,0.5309723,-0.14457902,0.9069346,-0.6361135,0.16953479,0.87958175,-0.41293532,1.1448647,-0.22025023,-0.83088124,-0.239315,0.36430782,-1.2948687,0.0005950441,-1.0110785,0.50332564,1.0514461,0.15143721,0.09145121,1.1076444,-0.16394418,0.10914068,-0.5807311,-0.5019789,0.2641913,1.1279031,-0.51443315

This leads to a major shift in Fo in these olivines to lower Fo values (a process very well documented in cumulate assemblages from numerous layered intrusions; Irvine 1980; Naslund 1984) with little or no change in their Ni content, because of the far higher olivine-Ni KD (partition coefficient) with decreasing temperature (KD = 7-8 at 1250C and increases to ~20 at 1100C: Li and Ripley, 2010). If the residual melt achieved sulphide saturation, then the sulphides that crystallized would be significantly more Ni-poor and Cu-rich than magmatic sulphides formed from parental basaltic magmas. This is in keeping with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the Navigator Prospect, albeit in very small amounts, is chalcopyrite.

The multi-element MMI geochemical association suite of the primary target suggests that the geochemistry maybe associated with hydrothermal alteration derived from an intermediate granitiod. An outcropping altered diorite was mapped immediately north of the geochemical anomaly and several rocks found within the area of geochemical anomalism show pervasive silica sericite alteration and maybe directly associated with the mineralisation. Follow up surface geochemistry will be required to infill sampling to a sufficient density to allow for drill targeting.

Native vegetation should not be cleared if the clearing of the vegetation is likely to cause or exacerbate the incidence or intensity of flooding Rainfall totals of more than 100mm are common within the Pilbara region due to tropical lows that move over land, and when tropical lows occur within a few weeks of each other the chance of flooding is enhanced (MWH 2009).

However, in contrast, these more peripheral hematitic alteration domains lacked the earlier hypogene dolomite alteration and were therefore not subject to the same level of iron-oxide concentration that accompanied the leaching of dolomite. The other line of field evidence that points to the formation of jaspilite during the second-stage hypogene hydrothermal event (that formed iron-ore mineralisation) is the presence of massive to irregular bodies of red and translucent chalcedony within some jaspilite units.

This makes the model of a Homestake-style deposit less likely, although there are still a number of iron-rich surface outcrops that remain untested. The intersections of significant thicknesses of graphitic shale in a number of drill holes, especially MORC001 and MORC005, provide an explanation for the Airborne EM anomaly.

The high-iron spectral targets at Yarawindah constitute loose assemblages of laterite outcrop which required examination at outcrop and geochemical investigation to establish their bauxitic or maficultramafic affinities.

The presence of organic matter or pyrite in and adjacent to the palaeochannels can present an ideal redox trap for the precipitation of uranium.

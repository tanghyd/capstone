The stratigraphy for the UG is poorly understood, comprising of volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks (acid, felsic & mafic), sedimentary rocks (pelites, shales and cherts), basalts (pillowed, tholeiitic and high Mg) and komatiite sequences (olivine ad-mesoorthocumulates and thin spinifex textured flows). The olivine adcumulates, host to Type 2 NiS mineralisation are the thicker lenticular part of the komatiitic sequences and were originally interpreted as intrusive dykes, (e.g., Burt and Sheppy, 1975; Binns et al., 1977, 1982; Groves and Keays, 1979; Marston et al., 1981), sill-like feeder chambers for the overlying spinifex-textured komatiites (Naldrett and Turner, 1977; Lesher and Groves, 1986) or ponded lava lakes (Donaldson et al., 1986).

These sequences are overlain by the E-facing Jones Creek Conglomerate, the basal contact of which represents a major Archan unconformity (Durney, 1972; Marston and Travis, 1976), dated at 2.695 Ga 0.015 (Rb-Sr total rock age; Roddick et al., 1976).",the mineralised komatiite of interest to this study lie in the ug a narrow 5 km wide in the mt keith six mile well area elongate 240 km long belt that strike nnw dip w and be dominantly w face the stratigraphy for the ug be poorly understand comprise of volcanic and volcanoclastic rock acid felsic mafic sedimentary rock pelites shales and chert basalts pillow tholeiitic and high mg and komatiite sequence olivine ad mesoorthocumulate and thin spinifex texture flow the olivine adcumulates host to type 2 nis mineralisation be the thick lenticular part of the komatiitic sequence and be originally interpret as intrusive dyke e.g. burt and sheppy 1975 binns et al 1977 1982 grove and keays 1979 marston et al 1981 sill like feeder chamber for the overlie spinifex texture komatiites naldrett and turner 1977 lesher and grove 1986 or ponde lava lakes donaldson et al 1986 however a more recent interpretation indicate that these komatiite form as channelize flow barnes et al 1988c hill et al 1990b 1995 dowling and hill 1990 these sequence be overlie by the e face jones creek conglomerate the basal contact of which represent a major archan unconformity durney 1972 marston and travis 1976 date at 2.695 ga 0.015 rb sr total rock age roddick et al 1976,False,-0.19800162,0.7577564,-0.16204287,-0.71385324,0.17546931,0.5209544,1.2796388,-1.0105805,-0.83472735,-0.24442849,-0.7021811,-0.41284287,0.18121563,0.17293304,0.42021042,0.4337556,-0.3822894,-0.9792098,-0.32415417,0.06770488,0.037446294,-0.24117239,-0.18042135,-0.8070264,-0.42647108,-0.3083776,0.11734213,-0.46874195,-0.4960895,-0.79831564,0.5641153,1.5168111,0.013305012,-0.92915964,1.167193,0.90841997,-0.97543865,1.5171309,0.20840625,0.40915698,0.09464228,0.3915061,0.092927694,-0.34923017,-0.47241387,-0.32398853,0.024173647,-0.1001292,-0.52803475,1.104265

A different range in one direction compared to another is likely to be indicating that grade is more continuous in one direction than another. 5.2 Directional Controls on Gold Mineralisation Gold and indicator variograms were calculated and modelled for Domain 2, all sub-domains combined.",model of the sample correlogram can be use directly in ordinary kriging and indicator krige the various parameter of the variogram model such as the nugget effect and range in different direction describe property of the statistical continuity of metal grade for example a variogram with high nugget may indicate that there be a high level of error in the sample grade be use to construct the variogram or that there be a high degree of variability in the grade over very short distance in the mineralisation a different range in one direction compare to another be likely to be indicate that grade be more continuous in one direction than another 5.2 directional control on gold mineralisation gold and indicator variograms be calculate and model for domain 2 all sub domain combine,False,0.37068596,-0.6435071,0.50138783,0.6708011,-0.28629544,0.4019605,0.06303832,0.38045874,0.8700115,0.25540176,-1.3229614,-0.15062426,-0.5307697,1.6622397,0.26127988,-0.4495642,-0.28811443,-0.029069282,-0.5230355,-0.60762334,-0.20948938,0.25462142,1.1492577,0.095263295,0.22156818,0.6690434,-0.050943404,0.6665527,0.18494076,0.082994565,1.2330545,0.5743818,0.051399596,0.8282198,0.15339042,-1.0564756,0.4251197,-0.37287995,-0.032089315,0.37634104,0.099889204,-0.09524909,0.68464184,-0.74190694,0.06525961,-0.38934824,0.20039241,0.065752774,0.5295376,0.78331816

A comparison of the means of original GMA core assays with the means of the St Barbara duplicates using a non- parametric hypothesis test, shows that although the St Barbara mean assay values and variances are greater, there is little evidence to suggest the difference is statistically significant (p value = 0.168).

Five areas worthy of further testing have been identified.

The carbonate sedimentary layers generated fine-grained microgranular mosaics of carbonate (dolomite) + minor sericite + trace leucoxene + opaques (?pyrite), and the argillite layers recrystallised to form a foliated mat of sericite + minor carbonate (dolomite).

Therefore, Standing (2001) questions many of the traditional correlations that have been made for the different regions but in particular for the Coolgardie area. Standing (2001) suggests that the stratigraphy at Coolgardie is unique relative to that in the centre of the Kalgoorlie Terrane or at Ora Banda, and as such he recommends the use of a local stratigraphic nomenclature (Figure 4).

This mapping also supports an interpretation that the Mosquito Creek Formation can be subdivided into two parts; the upper part characterised by interlayered shale, siltstone and thinly bedded, fine to mediumgrained sandstone, and the lower part containing a greater abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (interlayered with shale, siltstone and fine to medium-grained sandstone).",mapping by company geologist in 2005 show that the mafic ultramafic rock in most case appear to be juxtapose against sedimentary rock unit by fault be propose here that there may be only one sedimentary formation within the mosquito creek belt and that the thin unit of mafic ultramafic rock may represent fault imbricate slice of a volcanic basin floor upon which the sedimentary rock be deposit probably as a prograde submarine fan system this mapping also support an interpretation that the mosquito creek formation can be subdivide into two part the upper part characterise by interlayered shale siltstone and thinly bed fine to mediumgraine sandstone and the low part contain a great abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse grain sandstone and conglomerate bed interlayere with shale siltstone and fine to medium grain sandstone,False,0.005854937,-0.44686058,0.006685571,-0.50830936,-0.19169998,0.15055472,0.8355163,-0.024209058,-0.2256896,-0.6150418,0.010107126,-0.4646955,-0.29856178,0.312001,-0.31598634,-0.3937509,0.33976483,0.26233974,-0.7979039,-0.32116663,0.5282531,-0.29000372,-0.11096327,0.3061601,-0.70280415,0.5404212,0.024490701,-0.50431967,0.07547641,-0.71471,-0.09569356,-0.07178085,-0.09652763,0.35402972,-0.12199157,-0.39344302,-0.07573004,0.36059675,0.3031051,0.24285133,-0.05053757,0.3652316,0.082342125,-0.35942668,-0.1875321,0.18620591,0.69064265,-0.37484223,-0.36797497,1.0351479

Given the evidence for crack-seal behaviour, a model involving gold deposition in response to pressure fluctuations at the brittle-ductile transition may be more appropriate. This model is in keeping with the generally higher crustal level features of the Blue Spec Line, such as the limited width of the primary conduits and the association of antinomy with gold mineralisation.

Mapping by company geologists in 2005 show that the mafic-ultramafic rocks in most cases appear to be juxtaposed against sedimentary rock units by faults. It is proposed here that there may be only one sedimentary formation within the Mosquito Creek Belt, and that the thin units of mafic-ultramafic rocks may represent fault-imbricated slices of a volcanic basin floor upon which the sedimentary rock were deposited (probably as a prograding submarine fan system). This mapping also supports an interpretation that the Mosquito Creek Formation can be subdivided into two parts; the upper part characterised by interlayered shale, siltstone and thinly bedded, fine to mediumgrained sandstone, and the lower part containing a greater abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (interlayered with shale, siltstone and fine to medium-grained sandstone).

Following an exchange of information, DEWHA provided a letter to Grange indicating that the only outstanding issue was the potential impacts that the Southdown project could have on the Carnaby s Black Cockatoo.

The sediments have been tilted more steeply in this region due to the pressure caused by late forming granite to the west and south of the mineralization.

This work initially comprised a regional drainage sampling followed up later by additional sampling and aeromagnetic surveys.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 9.1 Conclusions The Project is a highly prospective conceptual iron-ore exploration opportunity that has the potential to contain significant amounts of Detrital and or Robe Pisolite deposits. Note that it is likely that the average P content of Pilbara ores will increase with time, potentially making the above materials increasingly attractive for blending purposes. The current depletion in the Pilbara Iron resource base at Paraburdoo coupled with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the Ashburton Project, should lead to an increase in interest by Pilbara Iron. The relative close proximity to the FMG rail at Christmas Creek may also attract interest from FMG, who are keen to demonstrate to the market place that they have the potential resource base to both maintain there current proposed rate of production their proposed capacity expansions.",this pattern of sensitivity be not unusual for mining project in australia conclusion and recommendation 9.1 conclusion the project be a highly prospective conceptual iron ore exploration opportunity that have the potential to contain significant amount of detrital and or robe pisolite deposit note that be likely that the average p content of pilbara ore will increase with time potentially make the above material increasingly attractive for blend purpose the current depletion in the pilbara iron resource base at paraburdoo couple with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the ashburton project should lead to an increase in interest by pilbara iron the relative close proximity to the fmg rail at christmas creek may also attract interest from fmg who be keen to demonstrate to the market place that have the potential resource base to both maintain there current propose rate of production propose capacity expansion,False,0.41771033,0.19742385,0.15717332,0.38721898,-0.6576679,0.47448337,1.0190673,0.40986058,0.9285158,0.63546747,-0.17416833,-0.26671857,0.22735862,-0.76013666,-0.2778382,-1.0671839,-0.022758132,0.13782121,-0.87285423,-0.02245984,-0.069248356,-0.20283157,0.3551514,0.57629544,0.17445503,0.7666922,-0.6702786,0.07771984,0.86017835,-0.239396,1.1148198,-0.23153332,-0.9550501,-0.12649198,0.2049952,-0.9867502,-0.046302702,-0.8870429,0.5220967,0.9438682,0.09957638,0.11074983,1.3510418,0.08402251,0.1946396,-0.67796564,-0.3839727,0.17890345,1.1505592,-0.2968757

In the West Pilbara the iron ore target was palaeo-channel pisolitic ore (Robe Pisolite).

During correspondence with Atlas, the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) has requested: the proponent undertake a habitat risk assessment and targeted surveys for SRE [Short Range Endemic] fauna, particularly Idiosoma nigrum to verify the presence of significant species in proximity to (within 200m of) proposed drilling or other disturbances.

This leads to a major shift in Fo in these olivines to lower Fo values (a process very well documented in cumulate assemblages from numerous layered intrusions; Irvine 1980; Naslund 1984) with little or no change in their Ni content, because of the far higher olivine-Ni KD (partition coefficient) with decreasing temperature (KD = 7-8 at 1250C and increases to ~20 at 1100C: Li and Ripley, 2010). If the residual melt achieved sulphide saturation, then the sulphides that crystallized would be significantly more Ni-poor and Cu-rich than magmatic sulphides formed from parental basaltic magmas. This is in keeping with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the Navigator Prospect, albeit in very small amounts, is chalcopyrite. In this model, the Fe-rich residual melts percolating down may become relatively more Ni-rich by dissolving any interstitial sulphides encountered as they do so, as S capacity at sulphide saturation increases significantly as melt Fe contents increase.",one possible explanation for this involve the infiltration of an fe rich melt into the main cumulus crystal pile and cooling as an intercumulus melt in the crystal pile this lead to a major shift in fo in these olivine to lower fo value a process very well document in cumulate assemblage from numerous layer intrusion irvine 1980 naslund 1984 with little or no change in ni content because of the far high olivine ni kd partition coefficient with decrease temperature kd = 7 8 at 1250c and increase to ~20 at 1100c li and ripley 2010 if the residual melt achieve sulphide saturation then the sulphide that crystallize would be significantly more ni poor and cu rich than magmatic sulphide form from parental basaltic magma this be in keep with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the navigator prospect albeit in very small amount be chalcopyrite in this model the fe rich residual melt percolate down may become relatively more ni rich by dissolve any interstitial sulphide encounter as do so as s capacity at sulphide saturation increase significantly as melt fe content increase,False,-1.0016934,-0.41706657,0.3386688,0.1873638,0.920098,0.60896724,1.8421556,0.53062516,-0.4875431,-0.72509205,0.3733447,-0.51467115,1.1922661,0.15854903,0.18665002,-1.9561956,-1.2699597,-0.25207114,-0.029975003,0.24812382,0.12374876,0.9089276,-0.8659812,0.43733275,0.019884985,-0.29186863,0.41229206,0.18916397,-0.085874036,-1.1693108,1.0536448,-0.3430382,0.43869194,-1.016667,0.6675826,-0.931383,-0.2796703,-0.06243332,0.6922159,-0.20849204,-0.18541479,0.3870647,1.4209837,-0.8044677,-0.2673748,-0.6773883,-0.2974059,-1.0004951,0.14505178,0.5155228

The TSFs were active until 2001 and historical seepage from these facilities resulted in elevated shallow water table levels and concentrations of key contaminants.

The other line of field evidence that points to the formation of jaspilite during the second-stage hypogene hydrothermal event (that formed iron-ore mineralisation) is the presence of massive to irregular bodies of red and translucent chalcedony within some jaspilite units. These jasperoid bodies display transitional or diffuse boundaries with the host jaspilite units, and may be up to 50 m long and extend across strike for up to 20 m.

This makes the model of a Homestake-style deposit less likely, although there are still a number of iron-rich surface outcrops that remain untested. The intersections of significant thicknesses of graphitic shale in a number of drill holes, especially MORC001 and MORC005, provide an explanation for the Airborne EM anomaly. The Au/Ag prospectivity along the strike length of the Monster vein structure is limited to the far western end of the drilled area and the highest gold grades were associated with a mapped cross cutting fault structure with a deep weathering profile.

Following this work, St Barbara Limited produced a refined working structural model for the Greater Gwalia area based on structural data from drill core and field observations.

Geochemistry indicates that a separate mineral system may be present in the northern portion of the Mt Mansbridge inlier (Area 1B) where the younger Palaeoproterozoic Pargee Formation sandstones seem to be in structural contact with magnetic Killi-Killi Formation. Here the Cu, Ni, Ag, Mg, (REE), (Au) and (Mo) values in the MMI survey show some preferential enrichment and may be a pointer to base metal mineralisation.",mineralisation within overlie sandstone seem to record a decline in u and hree away from the point of fluid egress with an increase in the proportion of lree possibly within the mineral florencite away from this location one significant exploration implication of this model be that high lree value in veined and unveine mesoproterozoic sandstone may indicate u and hree at depth stream sediment sampling may be a good first order exploration technique to prioritise mineralisation potential geochemistry indicate that a separate mineral system may be present in the northern portion of the mt mansbridge inlier area 1b where the young palaeoproterozoic pargee formation sandstone seem to be in structural contact with magnetic killi killi formation here the cu ni ag mg ree au and mo value in the mmi survey show some preferential enrichment and may be a pointer to base metal mineralisation,False,-0.49384785,0.2905473,-0.0066221524,0.15083645,-0.3220462,0.24173748,-0.28533852,-0.10606263,0.3271221,-0.4013861,-0.3941684,-0.48726285,0.19418605,-0.25799137,0.30503118,0.30926305,-0.2803539,1.449778,-1.2049938,0.5690302,0.28229448,0.7237373,0.3185214,-0.2237748,-0.41454032,0.23736784,0.8329724,-0.44576907,0.86612046,0.11603958,-0.81557757,-0.17428443,-0.09375928,-0.31097054,0.32675946,-0.57569736,0.038052037,0.45350504,-0.13575517,0.6231859,-0.0026099957,1.1859237,1.0765795,-1.0413691,0.46228808,0.46156523,0.03454053,0.65788466,-0.9390168,0.14473265

GEOLOGY: The Jeedamya area occurs at the southern extension of the Jeedamya Felsic Volcanic Complex. In the region of the Jeedamya VMS prospect, the volcanic package constitutes a bimodal assemblage of felsic and mafic extrusive and intrusive rocks, with minor intercalated sediment, ash and tuff, which are typically metamorphosed and structurally complex. Thick ridgeforming basalt caps the metavolcanics in the Jeedamya VMS region, with the fault contact between these units being a focus for the sulphide mineralisation.

The Tabba Tabba Shear Zone is a granodioritic suite that forms the eastern boundary fault of the Mallina Basin. The granite - greenstone sequence is characterised by the presence of a series of large layered mafic - ultramafic intrusions. The Fortescue Group is the lowest group in the Mount Bruce Supergroup of the Precambrian Hamersley Basin and is a generally un-metamorphosed and largely undeformed sequence.

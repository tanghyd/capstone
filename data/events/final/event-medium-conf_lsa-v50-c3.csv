It is not clear whether United Uraniums airborne radiometric survey of the area contributed to the discovery. No United Uranium report has been sighted by the present author, but a Rio Tinto Report of 1955 describes the mineralisation as being on fracture surfaces within, and adjacent to, coarse fault breccia zones which have been intruded by dolerite. The identified uranium mineralisation (mostly torbernite) is hosted by both granite and dolerite, as well as by the breccia clasts which include both Proterozoic sediment and granite. The fault breccia was interpreted to be part of the Dunham Fault (Denham Fault Zone).",appear to have be discover in the early 1950 as a result of ground prospecting activity of united uranium be not clear whether united uraniums airborne radiometric survey of the area contribute to the discovery no united uranium report have be sight by the present author but a rio tinto report of 1955 describe the mineralisation as be on fracture surface within and adjacent to coarse fault breccia zone which have be intrude by dolerite the identify uranium mineralisation mostly torbernite be host by both granite and dolerite as well as by the breccia clast which include both proterozoic sediment and granite the fault breccia be interpret to be part of the dunham fault denham fault zone,False,0.2716830700253248,-0.042477254716462104,0.01636496884393561,0.0358174620012007,-0.050345841820683516,-0.03509050335173547,0.011590053849034478,0.02906438546255912,-0.08591255341378139,-0.013195324746774312,0.027164140781862182,-0.008899180398602723,-0.047885285327253876,0.022595213648580283,0.013655894363518665,-0.05087099542557278,-0.07961629680193644,0.06687088455294528,0.030250988299409746,-0.043936563915771616,0.04925253284805411,-0.03523544896956907,-0.024798475139556436,-0.062327398802008556,0.034541892080240943,-0.008192949684093048,0.12555347339709574,-0.05716689493080878,-0.023246914587672397,-0.03551437903183046,-0.008500951155041049,-0.02836878976883192,0.1002973881136946,-0.0004833823025716567,0.06286819279080508,-0.016232456438882183,0.07790225985177292,0.015005290234353378,0.0805056467353304,0.030629013233170358,-0.009252345528361986,0.030900448701529193,0.020246633409654588,-0.009080073102210111,-0.012746044774006978,-0.01635558928088264,-0.0014329474563176863,0.01028439984721389,-0.057923765455773865,-0.041449771253391415

Changes in market conditions and the collapse of the nickel price toward the end of 2008 have prompted a re-assessment of the project, which is currently underway, prior to continuing with Detailed Feasibility Studies. Work proposed for 2009 will largely involve sterilisation drilling, refinement of the geological and mineralisation models, additional metallurgical testing and investigations into groundwater sources to supply the project.

Limited (CRA) during the late 1960s to early 1970s Nickel Boom (Tuite 1970) determined that the Jaurdi Ultramafic Belt correlates with the ultramafic stratigraphy hosting the Miriam-Bouchers nickel-sulphide prospect and the high grade Nepean Nickel Mine located south of Coolgardie which would suggest that the Jaurdi Ultramafic Belt is also conceptually prospective for komatiitie-hosted nickel-sulphide mineralisation.

The stratigraphy for the UG is poorly understood, comprising of volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks (acid, felsic & mafic), sedimentary rocks (pelites, shales and cherts), basalts (pillowed, tholeiitic and high Mg) and komatiite sequences (olivine ad-mesoorthocumulates and thin spinifex textured flows). The olivine adcumulates, host to Type 2 NiS mineralisation are the thicker lenticular part of the komatiitic sequences and were originally interpreted as intrusive dykes, (e.g., Burt and Sheppy, 1975; Binns et al., 1977, 1982; Groves and Keays, 1979; Marston et al., 1981), sill-like feeder chambers for the overlying spinifex-textured komatiites (Naldrett and Turner, 1977; Lesher and Groves, 1986) or ponded lava lakes (Donaldson et al., 1986). However, a more recent interpretation indicates that these komatiites formed as channelized flows (Barnes et al., 1988c; Hill et al., 1990b, 1995; Dowling and Hill, 1990). These sequences are overlain by the E-facing Jones Creek Conglomerate, the basal contact of which represents a major Archan unconformity (Durney, 1972; Marston and Travis, 1976), dated at 2.695 Ga 0.015 (Rb-Sr total rock age; Roddick et al., 1976).",the mineralised komatiite of interest to this study lie in the ug a narrow 5 km wide in the mt keith six mile well area elongate 240 km long belt that strike nnw dip w and be dominantly w face the stratigraphy for the ug be poorly understand comprise of volcanic and volcanoclastic rock acid felsic mafic sedimentary rock pelites shales and chert basalts pillow tholeiitic and high mg and komatiite sequence olivine ad mesoorthocumulate and thin spinifex texture flow the olivine adcumulates host to type 2 nis mineralisation be the thick lenticular part of the komatiitic sequence and be originally interpret as intrusive dyke e.g. burt and sheppy 1975 binns et al 1977 1982 grove and keays 1979 marston et al 1981 sill like feeder chamber for the overlie spinifex texture komatiites naldrett and turner 1977 lesher and grove 1986 or ponde lava lakes donaldson et al 1986 however a more recent interpretation indicate that these komatiite form as channelize flow barnes et al 1988c hill et al 1990b 1995 dowling and hill 1990 these sequence be overlie by the e face jones creek conglomerate the basal contact of which represent a major archan unconformity durney 1972 marston and travis 1976 date at 2.695 ga 0.015 rb sr total rock age roddick et al 1976,False,0.17065717594432003,-0.09626070096703505,0.02506626745512969,-0.01932135485010302,-0.05159255166399528,-0.04134042584672019,-0.003701995381027912,0.03869042253033277,0.025769340823406366,-0.017897934701898037,0.07705380308771262,0.008886470168301686,0.012819256029349744,-0.015595185778800709,0.002470932722409947,-0.012976204984882455,-0.029633037545404344,-0.06064780287780497,0.016038103917745402,-0.03058528113344263,-0.025095450837170238,0.0064305896644268916,0.009274882502765104,-0.0498875624201601,0.014479249126120948,-0.022603577378097997,0.028552538187037055,-0.012978580042357803,-0.00791601389911363,0.034478905248484876,-0.0034454916821715616,0.03870653882172621,0.01709859858345808,0.005168740466706185,-0.028324017681307868,-0.02117317640476848,0.01775327775036914,0.020721263102805466,0.007421169754004629,0.004985094095986138,0.022164736961187703,-0.022713456877449155,0.005163994507116295,0.002580168624565338,0.002665849989784007,-0.014481772228173885,-0.011118743433961237,-0.000651416380643515,0.023888287572876796,-0.008601988218801104

Capp, B.Sc., M.Aus.I.M.M., was commissioned to review the existing Herald Leviathan resource models for the Coolgardie tenements and calculations for both recent and historical data (Besserer et al., 2005, Capp, 2005a).

Igneous textures are commonly well preserved within ultramafic rocks but generally are less well preserved within mafic rocks due to more extensive recrystallisation of pyroxenes by amphibole and almost complete replacement of plagioclase by a wide variety of metamorphic products. The geographic distribution of the layered sills mirrors that of the basaltic komatiite flows within the Pyradie Formation suggesting that the sills are likely to be subvolcanic feeder chambers to the overlying extrusive flows (Cowley, 1979; Bright, 1985; Meakins, 1990; Thorne and Trendall, 2001). Structuraly, deformation within the South Pilbara Basin forms a classic Type-2 fold interference pattern with older Archaean rocks exposed in the cores of domal anticlinal structures, unconformably overlain by the basal Fortescue Group, and younger Palaeoproterozoic rocks, including the economically important iron formations of the Hammersley Fm, exposed within synclinal basins.

The Flying Fox, Digger Rocks and New Morning deposits are dominantly massive sulphides (3-15% Ni) in irregular bodies located at or near the base of high MgO ultramafics.

Uranium carried in solution and precipitated in recent surface deposits is normally classed as young and is not likely to be in radiogenic equilibrium with its daughter products that produce the measured radiometric signature. This means that the cps rate measured from a young uranium deposit might be significantly lower than expected and not reflect the true abundance of uranium at the site being measured. Holes were drilled using a reverse circulation air-core system and were logged using a down hole spectrometer.

The Assay results received for the diamond holes 08FCHDD001 and 08FCHDD002 showed negligible CU/Pb/Zn, which indicates that there is no potential mineralisation in the zone drilled. The negligible results could also indicate that only the upper part of the Upper Shale and Upper Hanging Wall were drilled of the Nifty Stratigraphic column, and these units have never supported any mineralisation, and had been classified as barren units. To obtain a bigger picture of the underground geology, and if indeed the geology is part of the Nifty Syncline, more stratigraphic units of the Nifty Stratigraphic column need to be intersected, especially the upper, middle and lower carbonate units, as it is these units which host the sulphide mineralisation found in the Nifty deposit. The author sees the Finch Prospect as low priority for drilling, but if any drilling was to be undertaken at Finch, possibly one deep (600-800m) diamond hole, situated within the outlined, strata bound Cu zone of >500ppm and another deep diamond hole situated north of the projected Nifty Syncline axis, adjacent to the interpreted WMC Fault and at an Easting of 361500E and Northing between 7590500N and 7591000N.",be recommend by the author that no further drilling be resume at the finch prospect as no mineralisation be find in the 2 diamond hole drill this year the assay result receive for the diamond hole 08fchdd001 and 08fchdd002 show negligible cu pb zn which indicate that there be no potential mineralisation in the zone drill the negligible result could also indicate that only the upper part of the upper shale and upper hang wall be drill of the nifty stratigraphic column and these unit have never support any mineralisation and have be classify as barren unit to obtain a big picture of the underground geology and if indeed the geology be part of the nifty syncline more stratigraphic unit of the nifty stratigraphic column need to be intersect especially the upper middle and low carbonate unit as be these unit which host the sulphide mineralisation find in the nifty deposit the author see the finch prospect as low priority for drilling but if any drilling be to be undertake at finch possibly one deep 600 800 m diamond hole situate within the outline strata bind cu zone of > 500ppm and another deep diamond hole situate north of the project nifty syncline axis adjacent to the interpret wmc fault and at an easting of 361500e and northing between 7590500n and 7591000n .,False,0.3118683711683754,0.02228512596458464,0.08220187342113498,-0.00792982273900429,-0.003668226913588926,0.08047758052918794,0.1080576205627731,0.05904363392190063,0.00819879116997204,-0.07223194925640651,0.05226525387863896,0.004794789665589589,-0.012097859641079655,-0.055175004200408335,0.0075662386855256695,-0.024569632488363587,-0.010820419765603816,-0.004697494234247412,-0.016368325178259435,-0.002827326341611359,0.014005255392140675,0.033537112194688724,0.05671598246711043,-0.05883226779046185,0.03425475533948989,-0.05627412739211302,0.05649856006809753,0.024723270368172984,0.026947147566262618,0.014553514501860336,-0.042834178855234016,-0.01767350042828172,-0.03921966452003875,0.0351577357981802,-0.01756883205532168,-0.04028350451081666,0.06415623991019676,0.04334329181754824,0.030025046691621853,-0.015416958661386183,-0.0014622012289750388,-0.05698392317505395,0.02159650576179562,0.03375038414673362,-0.008253250489425238,-0.0025408084229517386,0.017973247805163177,-0.04738381945116877,0.007511265127633975,-0.008233731003083633

In both the Panhandle and Airport prospects assays from the pisolites that were sampled reported Fe assays in excess of 50% but with relatively high silica (4 to 10%) and Al2O3 (4 to 8%) reflecting the weathered nature of the samples. At the Panhandle prospect, coarse grain sizes and wood fragments in excess of 1 cm in size were common, suggesting proximity to the basal section of the channel. This could also be inferred from the outcrop mapping which found significant amounts of basaltic outcrop nearby negating the possibility of a large channel being present.

Therefore, Standing (2001) questions many of the traditional correlations that have been made for the different regions but in particular for the Coolgardie area. Standing (2001) suggests that the stratigraphy at Coolgardie is unique relative to that in the centre of the Kalgoorlie Terrane or at Ora Banda, and as such he recommends the use of a local stratigraphic nomenclature (Figure 4).

Pit Optimisation utilising Whittle 4D and a Sensitivity Analysis utilising current mining and process costs, recoveries and various gold prices were completed. A number of optimisation runs were examined with the base case results showing that even though the gold price has increased from US$500/oz to US$650/oz (since the last optimisation in 2005), the mining and processing costs impact significantly on the value of the project. Including inferred ore had a minimal effect on the size and value of the optimal pit.

Past exploration reports of work completed within the region should be reviewed and data compiled in the context of aerial photography and satellite imagery to determine the next step.

This mapping also supports an interpretation that the Mosquito Creek Formation can be subdivided into two parts; the upper part characterised by interlayered shale, siltstone and thinly bedded, fine to mediumgrained sandstone, and the lower part containing a greater abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (interlayered with shale, siltstone and fine to medium-grained sandstone).",mapping by company geologist in 2005 show that the mafic ultramafic rock in most case appear to be juxtapose against sedimentary rock unit by fault be propose here that there may be only one sedimentary formation within the mosquito creek belt and that the thin unit of mafic ultramafic rock may represent fault imbricate slice of a volcanic basin floor upon which the sedimentary rock be deposit probably as a prograde submarine fan system this mapping also support an interpretation that the mosquito creek formation can be subdivide into two part the upper part characterise by interlayered shale siltstone and thinly bed fine to mediumgraine sandstone and the low part contain a great abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse grain sandstone and conglomerate bed interlayere with shale siltstone and fine to medium grain sandstone,False,0.23571390331307152,-0.11720711889333264,0.037342576806351294,-0.04138991604551464,-0.1281064298274765,-0.08449242005049468,-0.01446793839745058,0.09211582524396922,0.00778390403119622,-0.011345856694703303,0.13022246664057893,0.0209467497199002,-0.012289585558301752,0.03411612032979545,-0.028520938806326997,-0.02546495676231829,-0.027403902600300657,-0.10965095040741907,0.01232602816948814,-0.019353187588969843,-0.01079808401480132,0.011983630648405465,0.03549918899348374,-0.034134131292772686,0.035988753708633095,-0.05105294541166834,0.027374081851494907,0.008193188282762954,0.007506766945168761,-0.012145314985098153,-0.021781228908680037,0.052086305545096925,0.0010784669564904935,0.04542298888742198,-0.040162906467233805,-0.050815440532232935,-0.04797897964003913,0.035436330430363754,0.005327994139949057,-0.0347962641635196,-0.0019171300707379515,-0.0144449154582713,-0.007492557237473726,-0.035879961111046646,0.015979798749917392,-0.023701052849545053,0.042849003451056855,-0.011085328764622931,-0.004974941567976944,0.0027698390063692446

Given the evidence for crack-seal behaviour, a model involving gold deposition in response to pressure fluctuations at the brittle-ductile transition may be more appropriate.

Mapping by company geologists in 2005 show that the mafic-ultramafic rocks in most cases appear to be juxtaposed against sedimentary rock units by faults. It is proposed here that there may be only one sedimentary formation within the Mosquito Creek Belt, and that the thin units of mafic-ultramafic rocks may represent fault-imbricated slices of a volcanic basin floor upon which the sedimentary rock were deposited (probably as a prograding submarine fan system). This mapping also supports an interpretation that the Mosquito Creek Formation can be subdivided into two parts; the upper part characterised by interlayered shale, siltstone and thinly bedded, fine to mediumgrained sandstone, and the lower part containing a greater abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (interlayered with shale, siltstone and fine to medium-grained sandstone).

Smaller deposit scale faults follow the NW trends and are interpreted to control mineralisation within several pods, but are not well mapped within the deposits.

When a soil material is disturbed, the breakdown of aggregates into primary particles can lead to structural decline (Needham et al., 1998). This can result in hard-setting and crusting at the soil surface and a massive soil structure at depth, potentially reducing the ability of seeds to germinate, roots to penetrate the soil matrix and water to infiltrate to the root zone. Observations and assessment of soil structure were made at all surface soil survey sites within the three Project areas.

The sediments have been tilted more steeply in this region due to the pressure caused by late forming granite to the west and south of the mineralization.

This work initially comprised a regional drainage sampling followed up later by additional sampling and aeromagnetic surveys. Two magnetic anomalies (DUN07 and DUN08) within E80/2294 were identified as having the potential to be caused by diamondiferous diatremes. Follow-up gravity surveys did not reveal a characteristic low typical of a concealed kimberlite pipe.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 9.1 Conclusions The Project is a highly prospective conceptual iron-ore exploration opportunity that has the potential to contain significant amounts of Detrital and or Robe Pisolite deposits. Note that it is likely that the average P content of Pilbara ores will increase with time, potentially making the above materials increasingly attractive for blending purposes. The current depletion in the Pilbara Iron resource base at Paraburdoo coupled with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the Ashburton Project, should lead to an increase in interest by Pilbara Iron. The relative close proximity to the FMG rail at Christmas Creek may also attract interest from FMG, who are keen to demonstrate to the market place that they have the potential resource base to both maintain there current proposed rate of production their proposed capacity expansions.",this pattern of sensitivity be not unusual for mining project in australia conclusion and recommendation 9.1 conclusion the project be a highly prospective conceptual iron ore exploration opportunity that have the potential to contain significant amount of detrital and or robe pisolite deposit note that be likely that the average p content of pilbara ore will increase with time potentially make the above material increasingly attractive for blend purpose the current depletion in the pilbara iron resource base at paraburdoo couple with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the ashburton project should lead to an increase in interest by pilbara iron the relative close proximity to the fmg rail at christmas creek may also attract interest from fmg who be keen to demonstrate to the market place that have the potential resource base to both maintain there current propose rate of production propose capacity expansion,False,0.27347245717026325,0.0032559736681692752,-0.0849703907952989,0.057171610137067536,-0.11699929359611023,0.05548593971644977,0.038153175536588896,0.00014388910347060412,0.07247535150226175,0.03167842759619519,-0.029188920428329716,0.0015152591264797428,-0.06883037548672633,0.03343345581604255,-0.03046926642949871,0.00034438860810180605,-0.04068060523988831,-0.030317087041451724,-0.0508556141444642,0.0525837506160389,-0.059791506836832514,0.09770458848866981,0.005613974957889556,0.06896960137327154,-0.01687209224055506,0.014369803143917932,0.05690494079727188,0.04468158115474082,-0.02075735298531552,-0.03009923998986901,0.015200546676666211,-0.003149868806826418,-0.04058036017944511,0.021443638724658834,-0.02997819312044289,0.02724641508782699,-0.037140298822644066,-0.04236644038732447,-0.02538452624287488,-0.004216703778936977,0.029099174273721436,-0.052188702295446934,-0.03936755082742375,-0.013576790540725692,0.024836944460413787,-0.0072902830904803245,0.04663155479248378,0.05736013065177822,-0.007828691347700777,0.052811549745459166

This leads to a major shift in Fo in these olivines to lower Fo values (a process very well documented in cumulate assemblages from numerous layered intrusions; Irvine 1980; Naslund 1984) with little or no change in their Ni content, because of the far higher olivine-Ni KD (partition coefficient) with decreasing temperature (KD = 7-8 at 1250C and increases to ~20 at 1100C: Li and Ripley, 2010). If the residual melt achieved sulphide saturation, then the sulphides that crystallized would be significantly more Ni-poor and Cu-rich than magmatic sulphides formed from parental basaltic magmas. This is in keeping with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the Navigator Prospect, albeit in very small amounts, is chalcopyrite. In this model, the Fe-rich residual melts percolating down may become relatively more Ni-rich by dissolving any interstitial sulphides encountered as they do so, as S capacity at sulphide saturation increases significantly as melt Fe contents increase.",one possible explanation for this involve the infiltration of an fe rich melt into the main cumulus crystal pile and cooling as an intercumulus melt in the crystal pile this lead to a major shift in fo in these olivine to lower fo value a process very well document in cumulate assemblage from numerous layer intrusion irvine 1980 naslund 1984 with little or no change in ni content because of the far high olivine ni kd partition coefficient with decrease temperature kd = 7 8 at 1250c and increase to ~20 at 1100c li and ripley 2010 if the residual melt achieve sulphide saturation then the sulphide that crystallize would be significantly more ni poor and cu rich than magmatic sulphide form from parental basaltic magma this be in keep with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the navigator prospect albeit in very small amount be chalcopyrite in this model the fe rich residual melt percolate down may become relatively more ni rich by dissolve any interstitial sulphide encounter as do so as s capacity at sulphide saturation increase significantly as melt fe content increase,False,0.19532765322927378,-0.01592857288451022,0.05766288695555959,-0.015101956469345068,-0.08849763384959115,0.029341408189985634,-0.002546340728639062,0.05897384919011405,0.06025979666946639,-0.03994051916927615,0.03808162862941573,0.08636187601921984,-0.021165640052923824,-0.04823203586265438,0.03739151214555869,-0.04663202464066623,-0.04611513683840682,0.013996977411179924,-0.04221118106525525,0.04923501763347622,-0.011986675226605245,0.02159070500608659,0.0003664865641964091,0.00047783149688922395,-0.05947193333830741,-0.002670297377259738,0.019511408200976136,0.0010967715742058518,0.022658382743522974,0.017896965250353312,-0.02239816249304291,0.017328593698285884,-0.037538257104415385,-0.019477632147955934,0.02819893275134615,-0.061169235411720854,0.008167165980259653,0.01591864830363811,-0.0007387188161213584,-0.002983860473134236,0.037683490063333186,-0.026368016203028574,0.007246968977225685,0.021711309761062118,0.011134503686074663,0.003892308109689178,-0.007422212149398967,0.04089435347247761,0.0040096298944587916,0.01789097319410949

The Bosuns prospect occurs in the Eastern line, and displays both quartz vein-hosted and sandstonehosted gold mineralisation. All the old mine workings have been focussed on the quartz vein-hosted style which is associated with tight folding of the bedrock. Following a drilling program at the Bosuns prospect by Highlake Resources, the quartz veins were subdivided by Fothergill (2000) in the following types: Quartz veins parallel to bedding and cleavage, with larger veins present in slate hosts than in sandstone host; Shearhosted quartz veins, variably brecciated and enclosed by stockwork veins; probably the most strongly mineralised.",the main reef work on this line be the bosun where a quartz hematite goethite breccia extend for some 900 metre gray and ebsworth 2010 consider the gold mineralisation to be control by a complex interaction between anticlinal folding of a shale slate unit and faulting of the fold hinge the bosun prospect occur in the eastern line and display both quartz vein host and sandstonehosted gold mineralisation all the old mine working have be focusse on the quartz vein host style which be associate with tight folding of the bedrock follow a drilling program at the bosuns prospect by highlake resource the quartz vein be subdivide by fothergill 2000 in the follow type quartz vein parallel to bedding and cleavage with large vein present in slate host than in sandstone host shearhosted quartz vein variably brecciate and enclose by stockwork vein probably the most strongly mineralised,False,0.2570219926765341,-0.1051306032689422,0.07068202936720719,-0.022621697622238986,0.04857818206705207,0.03793349450041781,-0.03049426581854901,-0.02428065130544421,-0.043749171895386796,0.06537909975338538,0.04517291366632031,0.0008263262874142272,-0.08028911329461022,0.023531432816646953,0.009556231615096033,-0.07089342762954667,-0.056649170528902684,-0.046603586419066256,-0.004610327578897837,0.02229662251077646,-0.005291531437156321,-0.02602699108930737,-0.003600569550588441,0.012033480867745519,-0.035985039586877945,-0.053649165816334214,-0.018623406668974333,0.014990100174648417,0.0612336574873566,-0.00689434518743093,-0.012761600582975294,0.020113086632451767,0.08115500431579639,-0.022263082382971002,-0.008358568644087003,0.04590163959601478,0.028287212707761036,-0.0470508787021075,-0.047242788181051876,-0.019406825149113596,0.028233846987427435,0.07954351537138878,0.05408639055830836,0.0028555696827654168,0.03551451428256424,-0.0027985379170679964,-0.02198927332516111,-0.08830341410659216,-0.03558136764216592,-0.03406080364866459

All holes were shallow, with depths ranging from 14- 24m, and the sediments intersected consisted of units of sand and sand clays with lesser amounts of gravel with the fill overlying a granite basement.

The multi-element MMI geochemical association suite of the primary target suggests that the geochemistry maybe associated with hydrothermal alteration derived from an intermediate granitiod.

However, in contrast, these more peripheral hematitic alteration domains lacked the earlier hypogene dolomite alteration and were therefore not subject to the same level of iron-oxide concentration that accompanied the leaching of dolomite. The other line of field evidence that points to the formation of jaspilite during the second-stage hypogene hydrothermal event (that formed iron-ore mineralisation) is the presence of massive to irregular bodies of red and translucent chalcedony within some jaspilite units.

This makes the model of a Homestake-style deposit less likely, although there are still a number of iron-rich surface outcrops that remain untested. The intersections of significant thicknesses of graphitic shale in a number of drill holes, especially MORC001 and MORC005, provide an explanation for the Airborne EM anomaly. The Au/Ag prospectivity along the strike length of the Monster vein structure is limited to the far western end of the drilled area and the highest gold grades were associated with a mapped cross cutting fault structure with a deep weathering profile.

The mafic volcanics are thought to belong to the Warrawoona Group; the clastic sediments are tentatively assigned to the Corboy Formation and the BIFs and cherts to the Cleaverville Formation.

It is recommended, instead, that a change of support method and/or conditional simulation is used to develop recoverable resource models (less tonnes at higher grade than the bulk block model approach) for future resource estimates, reducing the possibility of overlooking potentially economic resources.

Significant bauxite laterite deposits were discovered in the Darkling Range by Western Mining Corporation in 1957. The deposits were deemed economically viable and WMC established a joint venture called Western Aluminium No Liability (WANL) and a special mining lease covering an area of 12,619km2 of mainly forested Crown land was granted in 1961. Scout drilling and sampling of the duricrust revealed significant deposits in the Jarrahdale-Dwellingup region to the south-east of Perth, which were later exploited after Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) joined the WANL venture to become Alcoa World Alumina Australia in 1977.","the distribution composition thickness and areal extent of these deposit be the result of interact depositional and erosional control relate to climate parent rock drainage topography and vegetation hickman smurthwaite brown and davy 1992 3.2 historical exploration the existence of bauxite in the darling range be establish early last century but exploration by a commercial entity do not commence until the late 1950s significant bauxite laterite deposit be discover in the darkling range by western mining corporation in 1957 the deposit be deem economically viable and wmc establish a joint venture call western aluminium no liability wanl and a special mining lease cover an area of 12,619km2 of mainly forested crown land be grant in 1961 scout drilling and sampling of the duricrust reveal significant deposit in the jarrahdale dwellingup region to the south east of perth which be later exploit after aluminium company of america alcoa join the wanl venture to become alcoa world alumina australia in 1977",False,0.19098008065270944,0.01912961136943627,-0.019620609645064294,0.012045125250438833,-0.027486311615934136,-0.07611174868486086,0.051205417608378295,-0.03331118185798377,0.010956079993563234,0.023221660173904528,-0.020899147461810205,0.037450060481744304,0.044251622562408374,0.03960347330863815,-0.021631020921866757,-0.011749613447465085,-0.10489459260538911,-0.03324284001855819,0.007787130315778633,0.00677622773340949,-0.0024920236707351054,0.020729848364080705,0.006498898428184675,0.029220271967006273,-0.007649892950718105,-0.005910645643617077,0.04076896970263758,-0.02095121497651387,-0.03433374087362326,-0.020652068211160456,0.0499007833911187,-0.030918332237046927,-0.026897699652012427,-0.018823031175188798,-9.302548093249704e-05,0.01459431465291987,0.03202253247876482,0.02235075494867109,-7.310390326884824e-05,-0.031209411996361017,-0.0004035371013809885,0.04077924368486517,0.026011779768068486,0.022802254661101466,0.004581059341799953,-0.012045469291154895,-0.01694678205243434,-0.0018651519806775199,0.040254473827280965,-0.02138235953726927

No significant mineral occurrences have been recorded with the Fortescue Group rocks.,the tabba tabba shear zone be the major division between the east and west pilbara craton the tabba tabba shear zone be a granodioritic suite that form the eastern boundary fault of the mallina basin the granite greenstone sequence be characterise by the presence of a series of large layered mafic ultramafic intrusion the fortescue group be the low group in the mount bruce supergroup of the precambrian hamersley basin and be a generally un metamorphose and largely undeformed sequence no significant mineral occurrence have be record with the fortescue group rock,False,0.21184193922612682,-0.10411892583699442,0.08096021111601961,0.01299513486393285,-0.06898361783764458,-0.13195744285876324,0.051898233880792975,-0.0014125328605019867,-0.012358677037117584,0.059425744413279566,0.08783508823255287,0.03560719326677289,0.04350569887740095,-0.01312166424743862,-0.06900217987133453,0.010152066117124835,0.004589359086662,-0.030931910054149525,0.032131681789187364,-0.05319841350459589,0.019210170202002386,0.03657653060651817,0.016696167209564124,-0.05956589490593939,0.06421981288282412,-0.04546186503642674,0.04738523172585022,0.0065318006884969824,0.005189808213990605,0.0038113781291686686,0.01057719626993801,0.010771283412816475,-0.02674149728754524,0.04146983870064978,-0.01920189799921917,0.028952581538482253,0.007460345709710743,0.012419438736890385,0.011794859567148713,-0.01605865986359166,-0.04654157160670344,0.02070931346943799,-0.05596702720422083,0.02039203514248825,0.002764682212913063,-0.02029087025755731,-0.0017221351745567428,0.02810346662736559,0.008050949988137891,0.017352572691281713

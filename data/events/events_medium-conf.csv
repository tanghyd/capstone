Orientation of data in relation to geological structure Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.

GEOLOGY: The Jeedamya area occurs at the southern extension of the Jeedamya Felsic Volcanic Complex. In the region of the Jeedamya VMS prospect, the volcanic package constitutes a bimodal assemblage of felsic and mafic extrusive and intrusive rocks, with minor intercalated sediment, ash and tuff, which are typically metamorphosed and structurally complex. Thick ridgeforming basalt caps the metavolcanics in the Jeedamya VMS region, with the fault contact between these units being a focus for the sulphide mineralisation. WORK DONE: The majority of work was focussed on the Jeedamya VMS target.",False,4,5,2008 2008 2010 2010 2010 2012 2012 2012,Leonora,"Diamond, sulphide","VMS, VMS, VMS","sediment, intrusive rocks, sediment, ash, tuff, basalt",,,"prospect, mineralisation"

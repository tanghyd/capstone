A potential problem was identified in that a fair proportion of E15/598 is covered by a thin veneer of washed alluvial and aeolian sands. Theoretically these surficial deposits would not comprise an optimum sample medium for soil geochemistry, especially over iron poor volcaniclastics and felsic volcanics that tend not to fix gold in the near-surface weathered profile.

["The Byro Ultramafic has been subject to exploration by a number of companies since 1969.","Previous exploration has been directed toward chrome, nickel, copper, platinum and gold mineralisation.","With the exception of Jododex Australia Pty Ltd (19701974) and WMC Resources Ltd (19761979), there was little substantive exploration by the other explorers until the area was acquired by Yilgarn in 2002.","Until the reverse circulation drilling was undertaken by Yilgarn, only shallow RAB and\/or open hole percussion holes had been drilled previously.","The Byro Project is a nickel-copper sulphide exploration project focused on the large Byro Ultramafic and several smaller satellite ultramafic bodies.","The Byro Project area lies in the Narryer Gneiss Complex in the northern part of the Yilgarn Block.","It is 35 kilometres south of the margin of the Yilgarn Craton which is juxtaposed to the Gascoyne Complex of the Capricorn Orogen by a crustal scale structure.","The Byro project area is within part of the Yilgarn Craton that has been strongly affected by deformation associated with this major crustal suture.","Geological mapping in the region has delineated a large ultramafic body (Byro West) and several small ultramafics (Byro East).","Most work to date has concentrated on the large body.","This ultramafic is surrounded by metasediments, which are in turn surrounded by gneiss.","Reference to the Glenburgh geological map (Williams et al., 1983) shows that the metasediments are part of a large belt of sedimentary rocks 35 kilometres long and up to 5 kilometres wide, with the Byro Ultramafic near the southern end.","The main body of the large ultramafic is roughly elliptical and is 6 kilometres long and 1.4 kilometres wide (Figure 2).","The southern end of this mass has a long thin sinuous tail.","This extends at least five kilometres to the south, and possibly a total of ten kilometres to join with the Bulgarro Ultramafic.","The northern end also has a tail, but its length is unknown.","The Byro West mass may be up to 15 or 20 kilometres long, with a width generally less than 200 metres except for a lobate central bulge.","The shape strongly suggests a dyke with a central, funnelshaped expansion.","The main mass of the Byro West ultramafic trends NNW.","This appears to be discordant to regional structural fabric trend in the surrounding sediments and gneiss.","These trends define a sigmoidal pattern (Figure 2) indicating profound dextral simple shear along the edge of the Yilgarn Block.","Shear with this direction and sense could generate a NW-trending tension gash, which could accommodate magma.","Continued shearing would rotate an intruding dyke (particularly its tails) clockwise giving a sigmoidal shape similar to that revealed by geological mapping.","A dyke with local swellings suggests a possible analogy with the famous Jinchuan intrusion which hosts one of the worlds largest nickel deposits (Chai and Naldrett, 1996).","5 E09\/781 Annual Technical Report, Year Ending 16th June, 2007 6 E09\/781 Annual Technical Report, Year Ending 16th June, 2007 Recent mapping shows that the metasediments around the main ultramafic comprise pelites and sandstones.","The pelites include quartz-muscovite schists and knotted schists and a banded iron marker bed.","It is possible that intrusion of the ultramafic magma through this sediment pile could have contaminated it with sulphur and felsic material, facilitating sulphide segregation.","The knotted schists indicate the host metasediments have undergone amphibolite facies metamorphism, where as the ultramafic appears to be lower grade (i.e.","greenschist facies mineral assemblage) and is less deformed.","Most of the main ultramafic body is covered by siliceous cap rock, ranging from a thin sheet of rubble to large bouldery outcrops.","Drilling shows that the ultramafic beneath is a relatively homogeneous body of medium-grained serpentinised peridotite (olivine cumulate).","Its core is unfoliated with igneous textures well preserved.","Within 10 to 100 metres of the margins the ultramafic is foliated with amphibole-chlorite-talc composition and is more pyroxenitic than the inner mass.","No flow-top breccias, spinifex-textured layers, sediment horizons or other signs of extrusive origin have been observed within the ultramafic.","No primary stratification is apparent in outcrop due to intense silicification or lateritisation.","Some concentric trends are visible on aerial photos and in magnetic imagery.","No gabbroic masses related to the ultramafic have been found.","The outer contact on both the east and west sides of the ultramafic body is marked by trains of vein quartz.","The ultramafic close to the contact contains large sheaves of asbestiform anthophyllite (or tremolite?)","grown in dilating fissures which have been kinked by a later event.","The quartz and anthophyllite indicate considerable deformation along the contacts.","This is confirmed at the two sites where there is good bedrock exposure immediately adjacent to the contact and in each case the rock is strongly foliated and sheared.","The contact shearing may be largely due to competency contrast at the ultramafic\/sediment contact and may faithfully follow the original contact.","However, the possibility that at least part of the ultramafic is now faultbounded cannot be ruled out.","The eastern contact close to the gossans appears very straight on magnetic images and may also be a fault.","Bedding and cleavage close to the ultramafic tend to be parallel or subparallel to the contact, and wrap around the form of the ultramafic body.","Dips are typically near-vertical on both sides, suggesting that the contacts also dip steeply.","Many outcrops around the ultramafic body contain lineations defined by mineral alignment, streaking, rodding, bedding\/cleavage intersections or minor fold axes.","All types appear to be 7 E09\/781 Annual Technical Report, Year Ending 16th June, 2007 congruent (parallel to the others).","In general the lineations plunge moderately to the south and are fairly consistent throughout the whole mapped area.","The overall form of the Byro ultramafic is a large lens, divided by several waists into smaller lenses.","This shape is probably primary, but may have been accentuated to some degree by boudinage.","There has been speculation about whether the elliptical form of the body reflects a lenticular intrusion, or ultramafic flows folded into a canoe-shaped synform.","The synformal model demands plunge reversal and the demonstrated consistency of plunge precludes this.","If the body is a funnel dyke, and is more or less in its original orientation, then pipes which fed each funnel may lie under the middle of each swelling.","Alternatively, the long southern tail could be interpreted as a feeder, exposed by strong northward tilting of the body.","The Byro Ultramafic is cut by several northeast-trending dolerite dykes of Proterozoic age.","ii SUMMARY OF ACTIVITY The Byro Project is a nickel-copper sulphide exploration project focused on the large Byro Ultramafic and several smaller satellite ultramafic bodies.","The main exploration activities carried out during the year were:

required.","Should analytical results prove promising then ground EM over areas not previously covered will be likely.","The Byro Project is based on an ultramafic complex that occurs within a metasedimentary and gneissic terrane.","The Byro Ultramafic lies within the Narryer Gneiss Complex, which forms the northwestern corner of the Yilgarn Block (Figure 2).","This area contains some of the oldest rocks in the Yilgarn.","The Narryer Gneiss Complex is the northernmost part of the Western Gneiss Terrane.","This is the most westerly terrane in the Yilgarn Block and is older and geologically distinct from the granite-greenstone terranes to the east.","The general nature of the Western Gneiss Terrane is succinctly described by Myers (1990).","More details of the Byro regional geology are available from the published 1:250 000 geological sheet and accompanying explanatory notes by Williams et al.","Ultramafic bodies have been mapped at eleven locations within the part of the Yilgarn Block covered by the Byro and Glenburgh sheets (Erong, Irrida, Byro, Meegea, Taccabba, Imagi, Partnership Bore, Noonie, Weirago, Mount Dugal, and Deep Well).","The main Byro Ultramafic is the largest of these bodies.","Most of these ultramafics were subjected to reconnaissance exploration for nickel during the late 1960s and early 1970s.","Nickel gossans were noted at Byro East (also called Meegea) and copper gossans documented at Byro West, but no significant nickel or copper deposits have been discovered.","Subeconomic chromite seams are known at Imagi (sometimes spelt Iniagi) and Taccabba.","Anomalous platinum and palladium geochemistry was reported in the 1970s at Byro, Meegea and Erong, but the old analyses are unreliable.","More recently Platinum Australia has discovered PGE anomalies at Imagi, south west of the Byro project.","The age of the Byro Project ultramafic bodies is unknown.","The surrounding rocks are Archaean, however if the ultramafics within this region of the Yilgarn Block are intrusive, it is possible that they are younger.","They could also be related to - and are of similar age to - the Proterozoic ultramafic bodies in the adjacent Gascoyne Orogen.","A total of 56.3 line km of fixed loop ground EM were completed for Byro East and Byro West from 7 separate transmitter loop locations (Figure 3).","The survey was collected using

located approximately 750 kilometres north of Perth, 300 kilometres north of Mullewa (Figure 1).","Access to Mullewa is by sealed highways and a graded gravel road from Mullewa to Byro Station.","The Byro Project area is approximately 28 kilometres east of the station along a pastoral track past Deep Well and Melun Bore.","Station tracks and existing exploration tracks provide reasonable access within the licence except after heavy rain as unsealed roads and tracks become impassable.","As the main ultramafic body is only sparsely vegetated four-wheel drive access to most of the body is possible except where prevented by large boulder rubble.","The smaller eastern ultramafic bodies are in more heavily vegetated terrain dissected by numerous creeks making vehicular access difficult.","The area is within the Byro and Milly Milly Pastoral Leases.","The Byro project is centred on Exploration Licence E09\/781 which originally comprised 26 graticular blocks and had an area of approximately 80 square kilometres.","It was granted to Red Back Mining NL on 28th June 1996.","The licence was reduced to 13 blocks and 40 square kilometres in June 2000.","Successive extensions of term were applied for and granted, extending the life of the licence to 27th June 2005.","The full area of the licence has recently been covered by five mining lease applications.","While these applications are pending the licence will remain in force with an annual expenditure commitment of $20 000 per year.","Exploration on E09\/781 was managed by Yilgarn Mining Limited for a period following a farm-in joint venture agreement with Red Back in June 2002.","Subsequently the licence was sold to Yilgarn when Red Back divested all its Australian projects to concentrate on developing a mine in Ghana.","Transfer of ownership to Yilgarn was registered on 28th April 2005 and Yilgarn now has 100% ownership of the project, with no encumbrances to any other company.","1 E09\/781 Annual

area of 209.24 square kilometres.","It will encompass possible strike extensions of the main Byro ultramafic complex and also prospective small satellite ultramafic bodies in the surrounding gneiss terrane.","Early in 2006 Mithril Resources entered into an agreement whereby they could earn 75% equity in the project.","The Byro exploration licence location is shown in Figure 1.","During the reporting period Mithril commissioned Digirock geological consultants to input and georeference geochemical data from historical reports.","A review of the data showed that two major geochemical surveys completed in the mid 1970s could be accurately georeferenced.","These surveys are contained in reports 7340 (1977 ironstone sampling by WMC) and 3545 (1973 soil sampling by Jododex).","The locations of these geochemical sample points are shown in Figure 4 and georeferenced assay results are included in Appendices 3 and 4.","A review of the assay results in conjunction with

predominantly over the areas highlighted in Figure 4.","No analytical results were available at the time of writing and will be reported in the future.","It is expected, however, that elevated nickel and chrome values will be returned as silicified caps overlying possible ultramafic bodies were identified at a number of sampling locations.","Exploration activity during 2006\/2007 included completion of a fixed loop EM survey using Geoferret.","The Geoferret EM technology is owned by BHPBilliton and operated by Solo Geophysical contractors.","Data acquired is contained in Appendix 1 and the final report included as Appendix 2.","No compelling basement conductors were identified.","In addition to the geophysics, a review on the historical geochemical sampling was conducted and Digirock Geological consultants based in Perth were contracted to convert this geochemical data into a georeferenced digital format.","Once this was completed a number of areas requiring further work were identified."]

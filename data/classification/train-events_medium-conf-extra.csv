Follow up surface geochemistry will be required to infill sampling to a sufficient density to allow for drill targeting.

The drilling was designed to test for a possible mineralised structure cutting the lithologies at Stealth at a high angle and thus explaining the lack of mineralisation encountered on the traverses 100 metres to the north and south. By closing-up the distance between traverses it was hoped that an obtuse orientation could be established and provide an improved understanding of the style and tenor of the gold mineralisation.

The current depletion in the Pilbara Iron resource base at Paraburdoo coupled with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the Ashburton Project, should lead to an increase in interest by Pilbara Iron.

Historical diamond drill core from the Highway and Supply Well Prospects was reexamined in an attempt to relate higher grade nickel sulphide mineralization to host rock and adjacent lithological units. Assay intervals by previous explorers were broad and appeared to crosscut geological boundaries effectively diluting nickel and copper concentrations in the sampled intervals. Re-sampling revealed for the first time the presence of high grade nickel sulphide in the mineralised system grading 5.85% nickel over a 0.5m interval at the Supply Well Prospect and 2.11% nickel over a 1m interval at the Highway Prospect. This has been important in establishing that high-tenor nickel sulphide intervals do exist (albeit narrow zones) within the lower-grade ore zones in the project area.",False,106,110,June 2005,,"diamond, nickel, sulphide, nickel, copper, nickel, sulphide, nickel, nickel, nickel, sulphide",,host rock,,,"higher grade, mineralization, broad, presence of, high grade, lower-grade"

GSWA mapping was also digitised. Significant discrepancies in location of GSWA outcrops is attributed to poor photo-location and outcrop sizes for both the GSWA and WMC mapping have been exaggerated. The GSWA outcrops have been relocated where appropriate and possible.

The relatively unmetamorphosed and apparently unmineralised Tarcunyah Group has undergone only a single deformation event and is most probably in faulted contact with, or unconformably overlies, the Throssell Group. In contrast, the multiple deformed and weakly metamorphosed Lamil and Throssell Groups contain significant mineralisation (the Telfer gold and Nifty copper deposits). The age of the older Lamil and Throssell Groups, deposited on the edge of the Pilbara Craton, is now placed at between 1790-1290Ma.

The mineralising fluids are possibly derived from porphyries that intrude the sequences although surface gold values are generally low over the porphyries.

The distribution of the regional stratigraphy around the project area is shown in Figure 3, which is based on the GSWA 1:250000 Wyloo sheet.

A number of conclusions on the geology and the controls on the mineralisation were established, which are important in the development of the mineralisation model for use in the subsequent resource modeling (Kitto, 2007).

Mineralisation is dominantly vein related and interpreted as having formed during late stage magmatic hydrothermal activity associated with syntectonic emplacement of a multi-phased intrusive.

Therefore, Standing (2001) questions many of the traditional correlations that have been made for the different regions but in particular for the Coolgardie area. Standing (2001) suggests that the stratigraphy at Coolgardie is unique relative to that in the centre of the Kalgoorlie Terrane or at Ora Banda, and as such he recommends the use of a local stratigraphic nomenclature (Figure 4).

Mapping by company geologists in 2005 show that the mafic-ultramafic rocks in most cases appear to be juxtaposed against sedimentary rock units by faults. It is proposed here that there may be only one sedimentary formation within the Mosquito Creek Belt, and that the thin units of mafic-ultramafic rocks may represent fault-imbricated slices of a volcanic basin floor upon which the sedimentary rock were deposited (probably as a prograding submarine fan system). This mapping also supports an interpretation that the Mosquito Creek Formation can be subdivided into two parts; the upper part characterised by interlayered shale, siltstone and thinly bedded, fine to mediumgrained sandstone, and the lower part containing a greater abundance of 1 to 10 mthick coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate beds (interlayered with shale, siltstone and fine to medium-grained sandstone).

When a soil material is disturbed, the breakdown of aggregates into primary particles can lead to structural decline (Needham et al., 1998).

Note that it is likely that the average P content of Pilbara ores will increase with time, potentially making the above materials increasingly attractive for blending purposes. The current depletion in the Pilbara Iron resource base at Paraburdoo coupled with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the Ashburton Project, should lead to an increase in interest by Pilbara Iron. The relative close proximity to the FMG rail at Christmas Creek may also attract interest from FMG, who are keen to demonstrate to the market place that they have the potential resource base to both maintain there current proposed rate of production their proposed capacity expansions.",this pattern of sensitivity be not unusual for mining project in australia conclusion and recommendation 9.1 conclusion the project be a highly prospective conceptual iron ore exploration opportunity that have the potential to contain significant amount of detrital and or robe pisolite deposit note that be likely that the average p content of pilbara ore will increase with time potentially make the above material increasingly attractive for blend purpose the current depletion in the pilbara iron resource base at paraburdoo couple with the possible supply of a significant amount of lump material from the ashburton project should lead to an increase in interest by pilbara iron the relative close proximity to the fmg rail at christmas creek may also attract interest from fmg who be keen to demonstrate to the market place that have the potential resource base to both maintain there current propose rate of production propose capacity expansion,False,0.5536801,-0.27585799,1.9373157,0.16315724,0.056899652,-1.1149697,1.9071678,2.2574022,-2.7511263,2.089234,-0.43060863,0.36587936,-1.0754606,0.021480924,0.6133851,1.9222332,1.4594458,-0.27333772,0.27252954,-0.9756263,1.7800385,-1.379074,-1.1380752,0.57682955,-0.82622266,-0.43052238,-0.07225546,0.12663034,-3.1770368,1.3991303,-1.8628997,-0.30382413,-1.6329114,2.6017206,0.8750062,-1.6645423,-0.0009793555,1.2310219,-0.7186498,-0.35404354,1.0024751,-0.552466,-1.2281629,0.414192,0.35213205,1.926171,-2.0735738,0.4910585,0.9754926,0.25519788

Due to a reprioritization of funding based on a slower economy in 2009 no field work was completed on this tenement.

This leads to a major shift in Fo in these olivines to lower Fo values (a process very well documented in cumulate assemblages from numerous layered intrusions; Irvine 1980; Naslund 1984) with little or no change in their Ni content, because of the far higher olivine-Ni KD (partition coefficient) with decreasing temperature (KD = 7-8 at 1250C and increases to ~20 at 1100C: Li and Ripley, 2010). If the residual melt achieved sulphide saturation, then the sulphides that crystallized would be significantly more Ni-poor and Cu-rich than magmatic sulphides formed from parental basaltic magmas. This is in keeping with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the Navigator Prospect, albeit in very small amounts, is chalcopyrite. In this model, the Fe-rich residual melts percolating down may become relatively more Ni-rich by dissolving any interstitial sulphides encountered as they do so, as S capacity at sulphide saturation increases significantly as melt Fe contents increase.",one possible explanation for this involve the infiltration of an fe rich melt into the main cumulus crystal pile and cooling as an intercumulus melt in the crystal pile this lead to a major shift in fo in these olivine to lower fo value a process very well document in cumulate assemblage from numerous layer intrusion irvine 1980 naslund 1984 with little or no change in ni content because of the far high olivine ni kd partition coefficient with decrease temperature kd = 7 8 at 1250c and increase to ~20 at 1100c li and ripley 2010 if the residual melt achieve sulphide saturation then the sulphide that crystallize would be significantly more ni poor and cu rich than magmatic sulphide form from parental basaltic magma this be in keep with the observation that the dominant sulphide at the navigator prospect albeit in very small amount be chalcopyrite in this model the fe rich residual melt percolate down may become relatively more ni rich by dissolve any interstitial sulphide encounter as do so as s capacity at sulphide saturation increase significantly as melt fe content increase,False,-0.8434519,-1.7385143,1.812032,0.76904804,-0.37817627,-1.9564077,2.0643787,-0.036741793,-1.5520895,0.40901157,-1.1728117,2.9542384,1.4704031,0.16726252,2.352252,-1.5990608,-0.37513173,0.62486386,2.1300359,-3.1123261,0.35920003,-0.5709431,-1.2651205,1.2058991,1.637639,0.8462912,1.4683962,-1.1019157,-1.4099858,0.28636378,1.0310024,1.2665725,-0.57162136,0.77160037,-1.4224733,0.61217135,-0.5973322,-2.1204903,-0.9304896,0.24121086,-0.48046094,-1.7873969,-0.8233397,0.7682082,0.46415985,-0.9089389,-2.3221986,-0.251827,-0.8200639,-0.9836129

All holes were shallow, with depths ranging from 14- 24m, and the sediments intersected consisted of units of sand and sand clays with lesser amounts of gravel with the fill overlying a granite basement.

However, in contrast, these more peripheral hematitic alteration domains lacked the earlier hypogene dolomite alteration and were therefore not subject to the same level of iron-oxide concentration that accompanied the leaching of dolomite. The other line of field evidence that points to the formation of jaspilite during the second-stage hypogene hydrothermal event (that formed iron-ore mineralisation) is the presence of massive to irregular bodies of red and translucent chalcedony within some jaspilite units. These jasperoid bodies display transitional or diffuse boundaries with the host jaspilite units, and may be up to 50 m long and extend across strike for up to 20 m.

This makes the model of a Homestake-style deposit less likely, although there are still a number of iron-rich surface outcrops that remain untested. The intersections of significant thicknesses of graphitic shale in a number of drill holes, especially MORC001 and MORC005, provide an explanation for the Airborne EM anomaly. The Au/Ag prospectivity along the strike length of the Monster vein structure is limited to the far western end of the drilled area and the highest gold grades were associated with a mapped cross cutting fault structure with a deep weathering profile.

No significant mineral occurrences have been recorded with the Fortescue Group rocks.,the tabba tabba shear zone be the major division between the east and west pilbara craton the tabba tabba shear zone be a granodioritic suite that form the eastern boundary fault of the mallina basin the granite greenstone sequence be characterise by the presence of a series of large layered mafic ultramafic intrusion the fortescue group be the low group in the mount bruce supergroup of the precambrian hamersley basin and be a generally un metamorphose and largely undeformed sequence no significant mineral occurrence have be record with the fortescue group rock,False,-0.31472477,-0.32362118,-0.5909771,0.57326573,0.35598943,-0.5831336,-1.2810347,-0.21249415,-0.11535018,0.20801611,0.4987788,0.3379336,0.8251916,-0.18010537,-0.6869015,-0.6526034,0.63099366,0.46851012,-0.46775493,-1.168579,1.3838711,-1.8517108,-0.21575096,-0.5486953,1.6171597,-0.4637777,0.752079,0.50357383,-0.3042706,1.5190486,-0.13727756,-0.056343943,-0.24084252,-0.5892012,-0.80509245,0.37908635,0.043920346,0.2024482,-1.1283344,-0.4945319,-1.8217076,-1.924471,0.8245993,-1.6614512,0.36984897,-0.6455928,0.3108105,-0.42509,-2.4971821,0.20320773
